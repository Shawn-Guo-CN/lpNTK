# EXP 7: Learning Difficulty

This experiment is to verify that the learning difficulty of samples in the datasets are mainly due to the interactions between samples.
To do so, we will: 
1) control the number of samples in the dataset, and see how the learning difficulty changes.
2) control the interaction between samples, and see how the learning difficulty changes.

The following sub-experiments are implemented:
1. `exp7.1`: control the size of datasets, and see the correlation between the learning difficulty on dataset of different sizes.
2. `exp7.2`: on a small dataset (50 for default), control the interaction between samples by control the similarity between samples, and see the correlation between the learning difficulty on dataset of different similarity.
