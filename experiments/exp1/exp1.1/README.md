# Exp 1.1: Statistics about the GradMatrix

This experiment is to get the statics about the following quantities over the gradient matrices between all pairs of data:

1. Sum of on-diagonal elements over the sum of off-diagonal elements: this is to determine whether quantities like trace/F-norm are certainly helpful.

2. If the largest element is the labelled element: this is to determine whether the labelled element is indeed the largest element in the matrix, and can represent the gradient matrix.

3. Gap between the max value and the 2nd max value: this is to determine whether only the largest max element is enough to represent the gradient matrix.

4. Max value over sum of the whole matrix: this is also to determine whether only the largest max element is enough to represent the gradient matrix. The sum of the whole matrix actually corresponds to the `pNTK`.

## Inputs

1. GradMatrix files generated by Exp 0.2: `data/{dataset}/GradMatrix/*.npy`

## Outputs

1. `results/exp1.1/{dataset}/on-off_ratio.pdf`: histograms of the sum of on-diagonal elements over the sum of off-diagonal elements.

2. `results/exp1.1/{dataset}/max_over_2nd.pdf`: histograms of the gap between the max value and the 2nd max value.

3.
