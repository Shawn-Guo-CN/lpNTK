# EXP 2: Get Kernel

This experiment is to get the kernel on each data set and its corresponding model. Since there are some legacy files from `exp1`, the kernel are calculated in several different ways:

1. exp2.1: re-use the gradient matrices on MNIST from `exp1.1` 
2. exp2.2: calculate the $p$-NTK on various data sets directly from the checkpoints.

## Prerequisites

1. Exp 0
2. (Optional) Exp 1
