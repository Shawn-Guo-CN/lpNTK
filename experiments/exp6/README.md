# EXP 6: Approximate Learning Phenomena

This experiment is to approximate various learning phenomena (listed below) with the gradient matrices and samples in the datasets.
The aim is to verify that these learning phenomena can be well explained and predicted by the gradient matrices.

Learning phenomena:

1. [Forgetting event](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05159);
2. [EL2N score from Data Diet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07075).

## Prerequisites

Exp 0

## Input

1. Config file: `scripts/exp4/config.toml`
2. Checkpoint files generated by Exp 0: `data/{dataset}/checkpoints/{iter_or_epoch}/{i}.pt`

## Output

None (temp)
