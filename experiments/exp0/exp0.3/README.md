# EXP 0.3: SVD of the Gradient Matrix

This experiment is to see the SVD of the Jacobian/gradient matrix. The hypothesis is that the singular values that are significantly larger than zeros are far less than the number of samples. However, the demo on MNIST shows that this experiment is **computationally intractable**.

## Prerequisite

Exp 0.1

## Inputs

1. Checkpoint of model parameters, e.g. `scripts/exp0/exp0.2/checkpoints/MNIST/LeNet_best.pt`
