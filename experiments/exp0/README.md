# EXP 0: Pre-training and Pre-processing

The experiments under this directory aims to pre-train the models, save the checkpoints, and pre-process the gradient matrices.
The following are the specific experiments:

1. `exp0.1`: Pretrain Models and Save Checkpoints
2. `exp0.2`: Get the GradMatrix with Pre-trained Checkpoints
